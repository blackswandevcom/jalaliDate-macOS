# [Jalali Date Toolbar for macOS](https://github.com/blackswandevcom/jalaliDate-macOS)
Developed by **[AmirhpCom](https://amirhp.com/)** at [BlackSwanDev.Com](https://blackSwanDev.com)

### 📅 Introduction
The Jalali Date App is a lightweight macOS menu bar application that displays the current date in the Jalali (Persian) calendar alongside the Gregorian date. Designed to be simple and non-intrusive, it’s the perfect companion for users who need quick access to both Persian and Western calendars directly from their Mac’s menu bar.


### 🎉 Version 2.0
In this release, we’ve made some great enhancements to improve usability and accessibility:

-	**Refreshed Menubar Display**: We’ve tweaked the menubar display to be even more clear and user-friendly, providing you with the information you need at a glance.
-	**Quick Peek at Month Names**: Added a convenient “Months Table” option, allowing you to view the Gregorian and Jalali month names side-by-side. It’s perfect for quick reference – especially if you’re like us and occasionally need a reminder! 😉


### 🚀 Key Features
+ Displays the current Jalali (Persian) date and Gregorian date in the macOS menu bar.
+ Automatic light/dark mode adaptation to match macOS appearance settings.
+ Minimalist design with Persian typography for an authentic touch.
